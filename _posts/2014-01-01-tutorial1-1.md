The xnlogic development environment includes a fully configured VM that allows you to get started quickly.

## Requirements

In order to run the xnlogic development VM, you will need to install the required software:

 * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (1.7.x and above)
 * One (or more) of the following [Vagrant providers](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/providers.html):
   * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 
   * [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion)

Next, you should install the xnlogic command-line tool.

{% highlight sh %}
~$ gem install xnlogic
{% endhighlight %}

That's it, you are now ready to create and run your first xnlogic application.

## Create An Application

Let's create a new application, called __`my_app`__, and start a VM for this app.
{% highlight sh %}
~$ xnlogic application my_app --key xn_user:xn_password --up
{% endhighlight %}

> The command above may take a little while the first time it runs, as it needs to download all required assets for a development VM.

> The (optional) `--up` flag tells xnlogic to start a VM, once the application is created. If you don't provide the `--up` option, you can start the VM later, using the `xnlogic up` command.

## Create A Database

Once the VM is up, we can create a database for our application.

Log into the VM.
{% highlight bash %}
~$ cd my_app
~/my_app$ xnlogic ssh
{% endhighlight %}

Start the console.
{% highlight sh %}
âžœ  ~  xn-console
{% endhighlight %}

And create a database called __`db01`__.
{% highlight ruby %}
jruby-1.7.18 :001 > PM.create_client('my_app', 'db01')
{% endhighlight %}


That's it! our new xnlogic application is ready.
