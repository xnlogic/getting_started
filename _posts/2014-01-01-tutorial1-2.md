At this point, we have a running xnlogic application that contains only boilerplate code. We will gradually turn this application into a simplified version of Twitter.

![Data model]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/twitter_like_model.png)

Here is a high-level description of our data model:

 * The only entities/models are `User`s and `Tweet`s.
   * `User` has two properties, `username` and `email`.
   * `Tweet` has one property, `text`.
 * A `User` can create `Tweet`s.    
   That is, there is a one-to-many relation between a user and their tweets.
 * `User`s can follow other users.    
   That is, there is a many-to-many relation between users (i.e. a user can follow many users, and can be followed by many users).
   
## Our Goal

In the next few tutorials, we will gradually build our application - An API server, backed by a graph database. We will use the power of graph databases and the xnlogic framework, to perform interesting queries on our data.
